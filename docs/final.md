## Title: Chi Team

## Subtitle: DishSaver

## Semester: Fall 2020

## Overview:
DishSaver allows UMass Dining Commons to easily and effectively communicate with NGO's (non-governmental organizations, also known as nonprofit organizations) about donating leftover food so that it may help those in needs rather than being wasted. This application allows DC's to put up food that is available, and then NGO's may request to take whichever items they choose. DishSaver is an innovative application because there are no mainstream/popular applications similar to it and it helps to simplify and automate an existing task.
