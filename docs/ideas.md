Innovative Idea: \
Our application will provide simple communication between UMass Dining Commons (DC's) and nonprofit organizations (NGO's) to allow \
the NGO's to pick up leftover food from the DC's so the food goes to those in need, rather than getting wasted. Each DC may list \
the food they have leftover at the end of each day/meal (including quantities, nutrional & allergen information, etc.) and NGO's \
may specify which food they are interested in picking up from which DC and when they will pick the food up. Once they select the \
food, it is no longer displayed to the other NGOs, preventing double booking. Our application will have a static map that displays \
DC locations on campus, and NGO's can click on any DC to see the food they have. \
It does not relate to other applications that we are aware of.

Important Components: \
The application will allow the two separate parties, DC's and NGO's to each login to the site. After logging in, the DC's may list \
the food they have available, and the NGO's will see the map of the DC's and can then click on each one to see which food they are \
offering. Additionally, the NGO's will receive alerts when a DC has new food to offer, and they will also be able to see a list of \
all the recent food that was listed in chronological order.
